## Windows with WSL

- Install WSL2

    First, if you have install a distro before in WSL2 then please uninstall completely that distro.

    ```bash
    # To get list of distro
    wsl -l -v
    # Shutdown WSL
    wsl --shutdown
    # Unregister the distro
    wsl --unregister Ubuntu
    # Close the terminal and open again

    # Install the distro
    wsl --install -d Ubuntu
    ```

    Install in terminal with command `wsl --install -d Ubuntu`

    Then, give the username and password. Usually, I set the password same with username. ðŸ˜›

    Run `sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade`
